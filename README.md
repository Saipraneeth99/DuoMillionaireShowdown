**Game Rules:**

- **Buzzer System:** The buzzer mechanism is integral to the game's competitive spirit. Here, dual teams view the chance to answer a question. The honor of responding goes to the team demonstrating knowledge and agility by hitting the buzzer first.
- **Levels of Difficulty:** The journey to the million-dollar prize is complex. The game is structured across multiple levels, with each successive level presenting questions of escalating complexity. As the stakes rise, so does the challenge.
- **Correct Answers:** Precision is rewarded. When contestants answer correctly, they proceed to the next round, where greater monetary rewards await. Every correct answer brings them closer to the million-dollar prize.
- **Incorrect Answers:** However, a misstep can be costly. An incorrect answer halts the team's progress, culminating their journey. Their final score reflects the total money accumulated up to that point.
- **Lifelines:** Players aren't left entirely to their own devices for those particularly challenging questions. They can leverage lifelines—tools that offer assistance or insights. Currently, two lifelines are available, and strategic use is advised, as they can be the difference between progression and termination.
- **Time Restriction:** A ticking clock further intensifies the pressure. Specific questions come with a stringent time limit—currently 60 seconds. Teams must be accurate and swift, answering within the stipulated timeframe.

Inspired by the suspense and strategy of the iconic "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game show, "DUO Millionaire Showdown" introduces the unique twist of cooperative gameplay. Here, the fusion of teamwork, profound knowledge, and nimble decision-making are the keys to unlocking victory.

**Design and Development Process:**

**Overview:** Inspired by the renowned quiz show format, our ambition for DUO Millionaire Showdown was to craft an immersive gaming experience heightened by introducing innovative features that make gameplay even more riveting.

**Design Phase:**

- **User Interface (UI) Design:** Our design, mirroring the iconic TV show, prioritized intuitive and captivating interfaces. Central design components encompassed the question presentation layout and the hallmark lifelines like "phone a friend" and "50-50". Our objective was crafting an experience mirroring the TV version yet optimized for digital platforms.
- **Game Mechanics:** Establishing the fundamental rules and gameplay mechanics was essential. Opting for a two-player team format added a unique dimension to the game, amplifying competition and camaraderie. We introduced a buzzer system to determine which team gets the opportunity to tackle the questions, adding layers of strategy and excitement to each session.
- **Question Database Creation:** A comprehensive question database is the backbone of any quiz game. This involved framing and categorizing questions and ensuring accurate answers were available. Additionally, we designed appropriate lifeline choices to assist players in navigating trickier challenges. This game's design and development journey has blended inspiration, creativity, and meticulous planning.



**Development Phase:**
